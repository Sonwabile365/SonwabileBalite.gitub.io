									<h3 class="major">The Student Representative Council (SRC)</h3>
									<p>The Student Representative Council (SRC) is a group of students elected by their peers to represent all students within the school. 
										In the year 2022 I was one of the two acting Vice-Presidents. My duties included assisting in managing the SRC board to ensure that 
									we operate as a 'well-oiled machine'. We organised multiple school events, such as 'school bashes', the first-year orientation, and a lot more.</p>

									<p>Unfortunately after a term of serving as one of the Vice-Presidents, I made the extremely difficult decision to step down, as the demands of my position were conflicting with my academics. 
										It was a very difficult decision to make, because of the passion I had for the role and SRC, but it was and remains the best decision I could've taken. 
										Prior to this I had a position in the SRC board in the Student Relations department and duties of our department included communicating effectively between the students and management and representing the students well.</p>

											<p>Either than difficult the nights of not sleeping because of difficult projects and assignments. One thing I'll always remember about university is the SRC, the role it played in my life, in shaping who I am today and
												the passion I had for it :)

											<p>It is tradition for the SRC members to wear personalised red ties, in order to help students on campus to identify them.
